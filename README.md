# Mextremes-Replacement
**MExtremes Python Replacement**
This project is an in-progress Python script designed as a modern alternative to the outdated MExtremes MATLAB plugin. The script analyzes output files from Design Load Cases (DLCs) and extracts extreme values for various load parameters in wind turbine simulations.

**Features**
Extreme Value Extraction: Reads DLC output files, identifies maximum and minimum values for each load parameter, and outputs them in a structured Excel file.
Scalable: Capable of handling multiple files within a DLC directory, automatically processing and identifying extreme loads.

**Current Limitations**
Under Development: The script is not yet fully optimized or reliable, especially for use in critical engineering applications.
it can show min and max values for different parameters but for now all of them are in a single sheet!
also it doesn't consider safety factors

**Future Development Goals**
Enhanced Data Validation: Implement input validation to ensure consistent data format and handle missing values.
Plotting and Visualization: Add optional visualization to analyze distributions and compare extremes across cases.
Customizable Output: Enable users to select the format and structure of the output file.

**Contributing**
Contributions to improve functionality, reliability, and efficiency are welcome! Please submit pull requests with clear descriptions of changes, and feel free to open issues if you encounter bugs.
